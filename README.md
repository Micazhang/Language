3. HTMLtoText converter: Write a program that takes the 100 given Web pages, and using Jsoup, converts all files into text. The text files should be saved as individual files for use in the next tasks of this assignment. Keep good OO design practice by creating a method processes one file. That method will then be called 100 times.

4. Pattern finder: Using Java Regex, find phone numbers and email addresses in the 100 text files.

5. URL finder: Using Java Regex, write a program that finds Web links (URLs) in a Web file. Test your program with the 100 HTML files to find the following:
    a. Links with domain w3.org
    b. Links that contain folders: e.g., www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/
    c. Links that contain references in a Web page and may contain folders, for example: www.w3.org/TR/owl-     features/#DefiningSimpleClasses
    d. Links with domain .net, .com, .org
